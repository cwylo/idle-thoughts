#We Need To Stop Calling Ourselves Cops

_Online community moderators aren’t cops and shouldn’t try to be._

How would you explain what an online community moderator does, to someone who has no experience of moderated online communities? Chances are you reach for one of two metaphors: [janitor](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/MediaWiki_administrator#Other_images), or cop. And I’m writing to say that we need to stop reaching for “cop”.

Cop imagery is a bafflingly popular way to describe online community moderators. [^1] I’ll preface this by saying that most major platforms seem to have [removed the most overt cop imagery](https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/4/21280121/twitch-removes-twitchcop-emote-to-prevent-misuse) when it comes to support pages for volunteer moderators in the wake of the 2020 BLM protests against police brutality, which is a good thing. But even if I’m well behind the curve, for posterity’s sake I’m going to articulate why we shouldn’t have started in the first place.

Traces of this urge remain. It was acceptable and popular not that long ago!

It’s not just in the detritus of people’s joking cop emotes. There’s a preponderance of shields as moderator iconography, to talk about our function as one of “protection”. Secondarily you see weapons used as iconography for mods: think of Twitch’s sword, or the often-invoked “banhammer”. You’ll also see this in professional settings, such as Reddit’s Trust and Safety team being professionally dubbed “Anti-Evil Operations”. And as always there’s an outsized focus, especially in academic study of moderation, on the punitive and visible measures linked to moderation. By which I mean, quite a lot of ink and breath has been spilled on the practice of banning: its effectiveness, its effects on those who are banned and those who do the banning, how to do it _more_ and _better_ and _at scale_.[^6] To a lesser extent this also holds true for the practice of removing comments and content as a part of community moderation. These are lenses for understanding moderation work that I myself employ, and quite frequently.

My point is, the reactionary removal of the most obvious cop related imagery has in no way addressed or tackled the core reasons behind its widespread employment. So let’s talk a little bit about what cops do, and what they don’t, and how that is or isn’t applicable to moderators. 

(Spoilers: they don’t do what we imagine them to do, only the most superficial reading of cop work is applicable to moderation, and continuing to use it carries an ugly baggage that corrodes the underpinning of thoughtful moderation.)

**Cops don’t serve and protect. They [exercise (violent) power on behalf of the state](https://patrickwyman.substack.com/p/police-social-order-and-exemplary?s=r).**

Let me tell you a little story. I live quite close to my local police HQ; it’s situated at a junction with a major road (Broadway, as most of them are called in most cities in the U.S.) One day, I was waiting to cross on foot. The light turned red, and just as I stepped on the road, an unmarked SUV _peeled_ out of the driveway of the HQ, driving across the pavement, down the cutout. Needless to say it ran the red light, cutting diagonally across the entire intersection, and nearly running me over.

I am also from Hong Kong, which meant that the back half of 2019 for me was an endless weekly nightmare of watching police geared up to their eyeballs savagely beat kids and fire teargas in some of the most densely populated urban areas on Earth. It’s why, when the police here unleashed the same tactics during the BLM protests of 2020, I knew what to do just in case our cat got teargassed. 

Hong Kong’s police are a legacy of colonial rule. We have some of the [highest police-per-capita figures](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_and_dependencies_by_number_of_police_officers) in the world, at 477 per 100,000 citizens. By comparison, the USA has 239 officers per 100k; Singapore has 177. China has 143. They’re a parting gift from our British colonial masters - when we were handed back over to the PRC in 1997, the police force simply dropped the “Royal” from their name. For all intents and purposes it’s the same institution. Prior to 2019 we didn’t usually think of Hong Kong as a police state, but in the wake of the National Security Law it’s hard to argue otherwise. At the very least, the government seems to think riot cops are an appropriate tool for [“assisting” with compulsory citywide testing](https://hongkongfp.com/2022/03/07/covid-19-hong-kong-riot-police-will-return-to-the-streets-to-assist-with-citywide-compulsory-testing-reports/). When all you’ve got is a truncheon, everything looks like a skull that needs cracking.

One of the consequences of mass protests against police brutality in 2020 was an outpouring of popular writing arguing for police abolition: the dismantling of a system that patiently and methodically [protects bad cops](https://www.villagevoice.com/2010/05/04/the-nypd-tapes-inside-bed-stuys-81st-precinct/) and [excises the good](https://www.vox.com/identities/2020/6/2/21276799/george-floyd-protest-criminal-justice-paul-butler) out of the others. The central argument is quite simply that the entire system of police does not care one whit whether a given cop is good or bad. The entire bent of the system is such that *all cops*, regardless of their individual morality, their sense of right and wrong, their good-hearted earnestness to truly serve and truly protect - once the system is done chewing them up and spitting them back out in uniform, once they have become cops, *they have to protect the bad cops* to remain cops. Thus ACAB: all cops are bastards.[^7]

How does this relate back to moderation? I mean, it doesn’t. That’s the problem.

Cops don’t protect, they traumatize. Even if you’re lucky enough to not have been traumatized by your local cops (yet), the fact remains that plenty of the people in the communities we moderate, who I hope you care about, will have been. This is even more true of marginalized communities, particularly as we seek solace and safety online. To model ourselves on cops, even if it’s just for a joke or an emote, is to gloss over the trauma that they inflict on whole swathes of the population of which we may be a part. It’s thoughtless at best and outright insulting at worst.

“But!” I hear you say. “What if I *am* in a community for whom the spectre of police violence is just a fantasy that happens to other people, and I can ignore all of that suffering because I don’t see it? Can’t I call myself an internet cop for a fun joke then?”[^2]

No! It’s an awful comparison because **what moderators do isn’t akin to police work** (or, for that matter, the criminal justice system), and equating the two means you wind up **drawing people who will make for bad moderators** while simultaneously alienating marginalized members of your community, as well as anyone else who has ever suffered at the hands of the police.

Remember what I wrote earlier, about the outsized focus on exercises of punitive power? We can dress that up all we want and shout until we’re hoarse about how it’s actually all meant to be protective or rehabilitative, but saying it doesn’t make it true. We all live in societies where daily exercises of punitive power from authorities is so normal and so common that daring to think otherwise is considered insanity, idiocy, or fantasy (or all three). Now, I want to make it clear that sometimes communities *want* their moderators to exercise punishment on others. And in order to enforce any kind of boundary at all for your community, which is necessary for it to exist as a community, you’re going to have to push away some kinds of people while welcoming others. Fine. Yes. We aren’t arguing against any of that.

What I want to point out though is that cop (or warrior) analogies attract those for whom the exercise of power upon another is a major draw. This is at severe odds with the day-to-day reality of moderation work, which largely has nothing to do with that and everything to do with rote custodial or administrative work. It looks like giving people Discord roles when our role-bots go offline. Organizing little contests or collaborative events. Setting the appropriate flairs on Reddit posts. Remembering, oh right, so-and-so probably knows such-and-such person who remembers how to change the theme for the subreddit, and could they please help with this game of telephone so that we can fix this one problem a user pointed out with our custom CSS? 

In fact that is why I previously wrote about volunteer esports moderators on Twitch. I wanted to purposefully pick the hardest possible environment to argue that moderators need “soft” social skills to be good moderators rather than just being really quick on the draw with bans. That’s why I chose an environment in which the vast majority of what moderators do _is_ nothing but comment and user removal. And guess what! They still do a lot of boring custodial work! And I didn’t even harp on about their secret secondary role as “person who helps let Production know when they’ve accidentally broken something”!

I wrote, in that thesis, about the disdain my interviewees had for “badge-hunters”: people who sought out the prestige and status of being a moderator for its own sake rather than out of a willingness to do the work of moderation. I’d add on a corollary: the absolute worst kind of moderator is the kind who seeks out the position out of unthinking petty tyrant’s desire to have their way. [^3] 

I don’t argue this just for moral reasons, although to be clear it is a morally abhorrent reason. I say so because the actual work of moderation is frequently unglamorous, rote and boring, and if one’s motivation for moderation is “I want prestige and the dopamine rush of exercising power over others”, *actual moderation* isn’t gonna do it for you. They make bad moderators because their imaginary picture of how moderation works simply does not line up with the reality of what moderators usually do.

Even when this imagery is couched in the language of “protection” you still leave an important question unanswered. Who are you protecting from whom? Are we to imagine that the weak commentariat need a big strong person-who-understands-Discord-role-configuration to protect them from the ever-menacing, ever-present Vandals? Sure, maybe you’ll get the odd drive-by troll. But why is our imagery presupposing that we are constantly at threat? 

I understand that there are absolutely communities for which this threat is not nebulous, and in fact very real and demonstrably present obstacle. Sometimes it’s less acute and we term them “trolls” or “vandals” or “spammers”, but it is upsettingly easy to point to swaths of angry, loosely-organized groups online that can, will, and do maliciously attack your community. In no way do I want to dispute their existence - my day job also involves a lot of thinking about the ways in which we do have a legitimate need to prevent bad-faith action and to mitigate the harms these actions cause. But I don’t think it’s a sustainable way to imagine what barriers face a given community, and certainly not a sustainable way to imagine what the primary function of moderators should be.

All the best intentions in the world doesn’t stop the fact that viewing yourself as constantly under siege or under threat *corrodes* you. Going back to that earlier point about how the systems of police ensure that all cops are bastards, a core part of how this is accomplished is through [the creation of this “warrior mentality”](https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2020/06/warrior-cop-trainings-industry.html). By inculcating the belief that they are always under threat by a hidden unseen enemy that only they can defend against, that they are Right and Correct to use force to protect the “sheep” (i.e. regular civilians), it makes it easier and easier to depersonalize “criminals” and deny any shared humanity. Which makes it easier and easier to become a bastard, and not realize that’s what you’re doing.

I’m not saying All Mods Are Bastards, but if you swap in “mod = cop”, it’s not entirely impossible that it could happen. And even if we never get so far, it’s just… not a healthy way to live. It encourages you to close yourself off from others and to see danger at every opportunity. Taken to extremes it encourages you to ultimately wind up ignoring the people you’re supposed to care about because in your role as their Protector, it is easier to justify to yourself that you know what’s best for them. It is a myopic and self-defeating way to live.

I think this fault follows through even for attempts to create a kinder, more just online environment. To work off the assumption that moderators are analogous to cops, and that the whole system of online moderation is analogous to, or can be explained through metaphors employing the criminal justice system, is to miss out on some basic truths about the ways in which relationships and social dynamics work online.

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">JUST WALKED OUT OF JEREMYS PLACE IN DA MIDDLE OF A STORY <a href="https://t.co/G781iJuepW">pic.twitter.com/G781iJuepW</a></p>&mdash; da share z0ne (@dasharez0ne) <a href="https://twitter.com/dasharez0ne/status/979810839749210112?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">March 30, 2018</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

To wit, it is monumentally easier online to hit da bricks and Just Walk Out of a subcommunity that just sucks. (It’s also generally far easier to join places, too, but for what I’m arguing leaving is the more important aspect.) And what underpins a lot of restorative justice work, at least in [those approaches that I have seen applied to online communities](https://www.wnycstudios.org/podcasts/otm/segments/restoring-justice-online2), is the operating assumption that everyone involved has a powerful reason to stay within their local community. [^4]

It is obviously much harder to spontaneously and unnoticeably exit your physical geographic community than your online one. And while I am strongly in favour of an empathetic approach towards understanding people who do bad things as people rather than as bags of malice with an internet connection, it remains the case that a ban or voluntary departure from an online community is generally less severe than removing a person from their local geographic continuity. It follows that it is significantly harder to convince someone that it is worth working through the shame, guilt and embarrassment of truly making amends online when the easy out is right there: just leave.

This works out in the reverse, too. To convince any given person to stick with an online community if they want to just leave is hard and takes a lot of effort out of the people doing the persuading. It is hard to fight uphill against the unspoken understanding that it’s much easier for people to simply go. That’s the main reason why I’m wary around the idea of applying rehabilitative justice to their communities: it truly only applies in exceptional circumstances, when everyone involved has that one-in-ten-thousand reason to stick it out for the long term even when the short term is filled with hurdles that make leaving an attractive prospect. It then asks that you invest this kind of goodwill, that you leave yourself vulnerable to being burned, over and over again even as people will rail against you for not taking the orthodox solution of just cutting people out of the space. No wonder moderators (myself among them) might be skeptical of taking this as our primary approach. [^5]

“Fine!” I hear you shout. “You’ve finally worn me down. I will admit that moderators should stop comparing themselves to cops, even for funsies, even if we think we’re doing it in order to make a better moderating system. What are we supposed to do about it?”

To which I would reply, being a janitor is a perfectly fine and honest job even if society at large fails to recognize its importance to the functioning of any healthy society. But outside of pithy quotes, I want us to be better at imagining what moderators do and how we should relate back to the people we care about, that we believe we have a duty towards.

To me, the worst casualty of this whole unthinking “mods are cops” line of thought is how it suffocates our collective ability to imagine a different way to relate to one another within our communities. How it truncates our ability to re-imagine what an ethical approach around our care and responsibility to each other could look like, online and otherwise. It also stops us from being able to fully acknowledge the ways in which the position of moderators is itself precarious, unsupported, and dependent on others. How are we meant to address the issues facing moderators if we cannot accurately recognize our position and our relationship to others?

It strikes me more and more that even as awareness of moderators and moderation as a distinct class of work, and as a distinct constituency of online platforms rises, the precarious nature of both remains. The technical permissions that we require to perform moderation work are doled out by developers over which we have little to no influence, and the centralization of the internet means that a truly popular community-owned alternative is more or less out of reach. Most of us have little to no formal training (in community moderation, de-escalation, even online safety), and it remains rare for moderators to ever receive it - to say nothing of who would provide such training, and who would even ensure we took it. Very little in truth separates us from any other well-respected or liked individual in a community except for the arbitrary acquisition of special permissions, and an outsized dedication to a specific kind of work that we are good at or enjoy.

The fact is that a determined, persistent group or even individual can overcome nearly any moderator. This is because the technical permissions given to moderators are truthfully incapable of absolutely, perfectly stopping all forms of unwanted behaviour, and largely serve to increase friction in order to discourage it. Moreover, a group of people who do not want to be subject to a particular form of moderation is free, as is the case with most online subcommunities, to Just Leave. Even if the resultant split communities are not quite as energetic or lively as the one they left, it is true that the (perceived or real) cost of setting up an alternative community and attracting new members is much, much easier to do online than it is offline.

Moderation is still undervalued work. When you bear in mind how many of us are burnt out and just tired of having to fight to be seen and heard and valued, I absolutely understand the desire to trade on long-standing social myths in exchange for just the barest bit of prestige. The seductive power of the “mods as cops” metaphor is that most of us still carry around a lingering belief or recognition of the myth of cops as something good, as some kind of heroic protector. Comparing ourselves to cops lets us borrow a little bit of that myth to use as a shortcut that lets us argue that our work is worthwhile, that it is valuable.

Moderating isn’t really a career, not right now. At best it’s considered a hobby. In some honestly niche corners of our culture there are places that respect what dedicated moderation is capable of achieving, but that is absolutely the exception and not the norm. “Discord mod” has just about attained the same cultural cache as being a prep, jock or nerd in high school but “high school stereotype” is an awfully low bar, and the flipside is that for adults who take this work seriously, it is yet another way in which that work can be devalued as something childish or unserious. Yet at the same time more and more concerns and anxieties about online discourse gets shunted off to our shoulders or to underpaid, overworked commercial content moderators. The work is valuable, it’s just that we don’t really live in a society that’s good at recognizing it as valuable, at best under-assigning meagre dollar values to its commercial cousin. 

But that’s their problem, not really ours. I want to leave off on something more positive, though. That moderation is undervalued is, as I see it, a loss for society, yes. Yet being free of the baggage of cultural expectation means that we are free to radically reimagine what a moderation approach that seriously centers ethics of care looks like, without resorting to impoverished points of comparison between malfunctioning or maliciously-functioning state apparati. 

That we continue to imagine ourselves as cops (with or without explicitly saying so) speaks to a collective failure to imagine other modes of relating to this work. We fail to acknowledge the dimensions and ethics of care within this work. We fail to acknowledge the ways in which unwittingly reproducing the hierarchies and apparati of the state is not only ill-fitting but actively corrosive to the wellbeing of our communities and ourselves as moderators. It doesn’t even accurately describe the reality of the work that we do! I don’t doubt that this metaphor will continue into the future. There may well be some communities in which the police are lionized and where the continued reliance on that myth will continue, even intentionally so. But that should not concern us.

I don’t know what a better or more apt or more aspirational comparison would be. Knowing that I don’t know is exciting! We should be free to approach this aspect of our online selves with intentionality, to approach this as serious and worthwhile endeavour in and of itself because it serves to help those we care about and to create places that enrich us through our participation within them. Inherent in this approach is the need to consider whose care we prioritise, the means by which we do so, and whether or not those means are actually effective. That we cannot lean on the myth of “protecting and serving” is a call for us to be better than that – to do more than just recycle an untrue justification for a violent exercise in power. The metaphor has never been anything but ill fitting. It’s time we leave it for something better.

[^6]: As a quick aside, I empathize with this particular approach towards studying this field, but I think it also betrays one’s perspective on the work: you are positioning yourself, as a researcher, with people who you imagine are being _acted upon_, a binary split between those who get moderated and those who do moderation. And again I completely understand this instinct in light of the fact that the most visible signs of moderation tend to be the traces of these removals. We’ve all come across chains of comments that have been rendered incoherent by the removal of their instigators, or the one-sided remnant of an argument that now is responding only to the polite blandness of “this comment has been removed.”

[^1]: I don't see it as much for commercial content moderators. Not that it doesn't exist, mind, but the self-conception/popular imagination for commercial content moderators seems quite different to that of online community moderators.

[^2]: If you’re ironically or satirically calling yourself a shitty comments cop in such a way that is indistinguishable from a straightforward invocation of the same, your satire or irony is not either of those things and you should feel bad for using such a transparent excuse.

[^3]: I think a reflexive, defensive approach towards the question of “moderator abuse” both reflects the extent to which this is a problem blown out of scale by people heaping further scorn on work that generally isn’t seen as real or valued by society, but also the fact that we secretly don’t have a good answer to address the very real possibility of abuses of power by volunteer moderators. (Which shouldn’t be our responsibility alone, but that’s a separate 10k word blog post.)

[^7]: This is my unsubtle way of encouraging you to read up about police abolition as a school of serious thought, even if (especially if) you don’t fully agree.

[^4]: I’m sure someone reading this will think, “Aha! But isn’t renouncing participation in social media or online platforms a significant barrier towards civic participation nowadays?” To which I will tap the sign that reads: “I’m talking about online community moderation so kindly substitute mentions of ‘community’ with ‘specific bounded sub-community hosted upon one or multiple platforms’, thanks in advance.”

[^5]: Again: my thoughts on the limits of online rehabilitative justice are a separate blog post. I’m broadly sympathetic but think it would have to be radically redesigned to apply to an online context.
